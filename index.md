## Emerging AI Developers

Workshop is oriented towards emerging AI Developers who are interested in leveraging AI-based technologies and services to build intelligent applications. These 4 hours workshop is focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented services such as Azure Bot Services, Azure Search, and some of the Cognitive Services. 

## Goals
Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, where possible, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of a broader example.

At the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

•	Understand how to configure your apps to call Cognitive Services

•	Build an application that calls various Cognitive Services APIs (specifically Computer Vision)

•	Understand how to implement Azure Search features to provide a positive search experience inside applications

•	Configure an Azure Search service to extend your data to enable full-text, language-aware search

•	Build, train, and publish a LUIS model to help your bot communicate effectively

•	Build an intelligent bot using Microsoft Bot Framework that leverages LUIS and Azure Search

•	Effectively log chat conversations in your bot

•	Perform rapid development/testing with Ngrok and test your bots with unit tests and direct bot communication

•	Effectively leverage the custom vision service to create image classification services that can then be leveraged by an application
